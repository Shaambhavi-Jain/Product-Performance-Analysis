### Project Overview
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of sales performance across multiple product lines for a company, utilizing sales data from Q4 2013 to Q4 2014, with the objective of identifying trends, patterns, and opportunities for growth.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are: 
- Conduct a comparative analysis of monthly or quarterly sales performance.
- Identify top-performing segments and products based on sales data.
- Analyze sales trends and patterns over time to identify growth opportunities.
- Pinpoint products with declining profitability.
- Determine the factors influencing product performance.
- Develop recommendations for product optimization and strategy development.

### Data Analysis Process
- Data was acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anuchhetry/product-sales).
- Data was cleaned and structured using Microsoft Excel.
- Data exploration was performed using SQL queries.
- A [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shaambhavi.jain/viz/ProductSalesDashbaord/ProductSalesDashboard4) was constructed to provide actionable insights from the data.

### Key Performance Indicators
- Sales revenue
- Sales volume
- Profit margins
- Customer segmentation analysis
- Quarter over Quarter growth
- Month over Month growth

### Dimensions Analysed
The products were analysed across 4 major dimensions: 
- Products
- Geographies (countires)
- Economic segments
- Time (monthly and quarterly)

### Key Findings
Some highlights from the dashboards are:
- Paseo was the most profitable product, contributing 30% to overall profits.
- Sales dropped by 9.5% for 3 products in the fourth quarter of 2014.
- Products in the enterprise economic segment (priced at $125) were identified as unprofitable.

### Recommendations
- Invest in Paseo, analyze its success factors, and apply learnings to other products.
- Conduct a thorough analysis of the 3 products with declining sales to understand the reasons for the sales drop, consider repositioning or discontinuing, and monitor competitors.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of products in the enterprise segment to determine if they should be redesigned or repositioned. Pricing strategy can also be reassessed.
