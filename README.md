## Key Findings:
Created a Tableau dashboard to visualize data trends and patterns. Some highlights from the dashboards are:
- Paseo was the most profitable product, contributing 30% to overall profits.
- Sales dropped by 9.5% for 3 products in the fourth quarter of 2014.
- Products in the enterprise economic segment were identified as unprofitable.

## Recommendations:

- Conduct a thorough analysis of the 3 products with declining sales to understand the reasons for the sales drop, consider repositioning or discontinuing, and monitor competitors.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of products in the enterprise segment to determine if they should be redesigned or repositioned. Pricing strategy can also be reassessed.
